# Ultimate Air Purifier Buying Guide: How to Choose the Best One for Your Home (2026 Edition)

This comprehensive guide helps you select the perfect air purifier for Indian homes, considering pollution levels, room sizes, and budget. Whether in Indore or Delhi, find expert tips, comparisons, and tables to make an informed decision.[web:1][web:11]

## Why You Need an Air Purifier

Air purifiers remove pollutants like PM2.5, dust, allergens, and odors, essential in India's high AQI cities. They use filters to cycle air multiple times per hour, improving indoor quality by up to 93% in tests.[web:1][web:5]

Models like Coway and Levoit excel in particle removal for large rooms.[web:1]

## Key Factors to Consider

- **Room Size and Coverage**: Match purifier to your space; undersized units underperform.[web:4]
- **CADR Rating**: Clean Air Delivery Rate measures efficiency—higher is better for faster purification.[web:2][web:8]
- **Filter Types**: Prioritize True HEPA (99.97% at 0.3 microns) plus activated carbon for gases.[web:6][web:19]
- **ACH (Air Changes/Hour)**: Aim for 4-5 ACH; calculates as CADR relative to room volume.[web:1]
- **Noise Level**: Under 50dB for bedrooms.[web:2]
- **Smart Features**: App control, sensors for auto mode.[web:1]
- **Maintenance Costs**: Filter replacements every 6-12 months; budget ₹2,000-5,000/year.[web:20]
- **Certifications**: AHAM Verifide, CARB for safety.[web:1]

## CADR and Room Size Guide

Use this table to match CADR to room size (8ft ceilings, 4 ACH recommended). For polluted areas, choose higher ACH.[web:4][web:13][web:18]
