# **How to Buy an Air Conditioner (AC) in 2026 According to Your Needs**

<br />

## 1. **Choose the Right AC Type**
Split AC for homes, Window AC for small rooms, and Portable AC for flexibility.

<br />

## 2. **Select the Correct Tonnage**
1 Ton: Up to 120 sq ft  
1.5 Ton: 120–180 sq ft  
2 Ton: 180+ sq ft  

Choose according to room size and ceiling height.

<br />

## 3. **Check Energy Rating**
Prefer 4-Star or 5-Star BEE rating for better electricity savings.

<br />

## 4. **Inverter vs Non-Inverter**
Inverter AC adjusts compressor speed for efficiency and lower bills. Non-inverter is cheaper but consumes more power.

<br />

## 5. **Cooling Capacity (BTU)**
Higher BTU = faster cooling. Match BTU to room size.

<br />

## 6. **Copper vs Aluminum Coil**
Copper coils are more durable, easier to maintain, and provide better heat transfer.

<br />

## 7. **Climate Consideration**
If you live in very hot areas (like North India), choose models built for high ambient temperatures (50°C+).

<br />

## 8. **Noise Level**
Indoor unit should ideally be below 45 dB for bedrooms.

<br />

## 9. **Air Filters**
Look for dust filters, PM2.5 filters, anti-bacterial filters, or air purification features.

<br />

## 10. **Smart Features**
Wi-Fi control, mobile app, voice assistant compatibility (Alexa/Google).

<br />

## 11. **Power Consumption**
Check annual energy consumption mentioned on BEE label.

<br />

## 12. **Stabilizer Requirement**
Choose AC with built-in stabilizer support if voltage fluctuations are common.

<br />

## 13. **Installation Cost**
Consider extra cost for copper pipe length, stand, or drilling.

<br />

## 14. **Warranty Coverage**
At least 1 year comprehensive + 5–10 years compressor warranty.

<br />

## 15. **After-Sales Service**
Choose brands with strong service networks in your city.

<br />

## 16. **Convertible Modes**
Some inverter ACs offer 4-in-1 or 5-in-1 convertible cooling to adjust capacity and save power.

<br />

## 17. **Refrigerant Type**
R32 or R410A are common eco-friendly refrigerants in 2026.

<br />

## 18. **Dehumidification Mode**
Useful during monsoon season.

<br />

## 19. **Design & Indoor Unit Size**
Ensure it fits your wall space and room aesthetics.

<br />

## 20. **Final Comparison**
Compare tonnage, star rating, inverter tech, and long-term electricity cost before buying.
