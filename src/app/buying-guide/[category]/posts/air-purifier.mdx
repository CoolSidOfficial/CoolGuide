  # **How to Buy an Air Purifier in 2026 According to Your Needs**
   <br/>
<br/>
## 1. **Check Your Room Size**
Measure your room in square feet and choose a purifier that supports that coverage area.

<br/>
## 2. **Understand CADR Rating**
Higher CADR (Clean Air Delivery Rate) means faster air cleaning. Match CADR to your room size.

<br/>
## 3. **Choose True HEPA Filter**
Always prefer True HEPA (H13/H14) for removing PM2.5, dust, pollen, and allergens.

<br/>
## 4. **Activated Carbon Filter**
Important for removing odors, smoke, VOCs, and kitchen smells.

<br/>
## 5. **Pre-Filter Availability**
Washable pre-filters increase lifespan of HEPA filters and reduce maintenance cost.

<br/>
## 6. **Check PM2.5 Sensor**
Smart air purifiers display real-time AQI and automatically adjust speed.

<br/>
## 7. **Noise Levels**
For bedrooms, choose models with sleep mode and low dB levels.

<br/>
## 8. **Filter Replacement Cost**
Check how often filters need replacement (6–12 months) and their price.

<br/>
## 9. **Energy Consumption**
Choose energy-efficient models if running 24/7.

<br/>
## 10. **Smart Features**
Wi-Fi control, app monitoring, and auto mode add convenience.

<br/>
## 11. **Air Changes Per Hour (ACH)**
Higher ACH means the air is cleaned multiple times per hour.

<br/>
## 12. **Ozone-Free Technology**
Avoid ionizers that produce ozone; ensure it is ozone-safe.

<br/>
## 13. **Portability**
Consider weight and handle design if moving between rooms.

<br/>
## 14. **Design and Placement**
360° air intake models work better when placed in open areas.

<br/>
## 15. **Coverage for Indian Pollution Levels**
Ensure the purifier can handle high AQI and Delhi-level pollution spikes.

<br/>
## 16. **Child Lock & Safety**
Important if you have kids at home.

<br/>
## 17. **Brand Reliability**
Check reviews, service centers, and spare filter availability.

<br/>
## 18. **Warranty Period**
Minimum 1-year warranty; motor warranty should ideally be longer.

<br/>
## 19. **Maintenance Requirements**
Easy filter replacement and cleaning access saves time.

<br/>
## 20. **Final Comparison**
Compare CADR, filter type, noise level, and long-term cost before buying.
