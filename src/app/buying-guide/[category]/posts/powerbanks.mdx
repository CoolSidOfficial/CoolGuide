# **How to Buy a Power Bank in 2026 According to Your Needs**

<br />

## 1. **Determine Your Usage**
Are you buying for phones, laptops, tablets, or multiple devices?

<br />

## 2. **Check Capacity (mAh)**
Higher mAh means more charges — 10,000 mAh+ is great for phones, 20,000 mAh+ for tablets/laptops.

<br />

## 3. **Understand Real vs Rated Capacity**
Actual usable capacity is ~60–80% of the listed mAh due to conversion losses.

<br />

## 4. **Look at Output Ports**
USB-A, USB-C, Lightning — choose what your devices support.

<br />

## 5. **Power Delivery (PD) Support**
PD delivers faster charging for phones and laptops — look for 18 W+ or 30 W+.

<br />

## 6. **Input Charging Speed**
Fast input (like PD in) lets the power bank recharge quickly.

<br />

## 7. **Number of Output Ports**
More ports = more simultaneous devices charging.

<br />

## 8. **Pass-Through Charging**
Useful if you want to charge device and power bank at the same time.

<br />

## 9. **Build Quality**
Metal or durable plastic housing resists drops and wear.

<br />

## 10. **Safety Features**
Over-current, over-voltage, temperature, and short-circuit protection are essential.

<br />

## 11. **Weight & Portability**
Higher capacity often means heavier — balance size with need.

<br />

## 12. **LED Indicators**
Shows remaining battery level so you know when to recharge.

<br />

## 13. **Charging Cables Included**
Some power banks include USB-C or Lightning cables — a nice bonus.

<br />

## 14. **Brand Reputation**
Choose trusted brands for reliability and safety.

<br />

## 15. **Warranty & Support**
Minimum 1 year preferred; check service options.

<br />

## 16. **Check Real-World Tests**
Look at reviews for real capacity and charging behavior.

<br />

## 17. **Price vs Performance**
Compare features and capacity for the price range you’re comfortable with.

<br />

## 18. **Laptop Compatibility**
If you plan to charge laptops, make sure it supports 45–100 W output with PD.

<br />

## 19. **Travel Friendly Features**
Airline-approved units and safety certifications matter for flying.

<br />

## 20. **Final Comparison**
Compare capacity, output power, safety, and weight before buying.
